# NBA-Draft-Player-Grades
This program grades and ranks prospects based on a back-tested weighted sum of all major statistics. The inspiration behind this project was I wanted to figure out what truly separated the players who turned out to be All-Stars versus players that never seemed to pan out in the league. I manually created a big spreadsheet of the collegiate stats of all the All-Star-level players in the NBA and compared their averages to the averages of a large list of players who were drafted highly but never found success. What I discovered was the biggest indicator of future success in the NBA was the amount of three pointers each player attemped in college. On average, players who turned out to be All-Star-level players shot almost 66% more threes per game in college and made an additional 57% of those threes. All-star-level players also averaged 38% more assists per game and 37% more steals. Every major statistic was compared and weighted proporionally to create a formula to more accurately rank the players. Stats are based on each player's final collegiate season. Pictured below are the historically good draft classes of 2009 and 2011 ranked with my formula.
